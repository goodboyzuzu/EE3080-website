            A Zener diode is designed to have a reduced breakdown voltage, the so-called Zener voltage. It exhibits a controlled breakdown and allows the current to keep the voltage across the Zener diode close to the Zener breakdown voltage.<br/>Zener breakdown occurs in heavily doped junctions in which the transition from the p side to the n side is very abrupt. Under these conditions, the potential barrier separating carriers on the two sides of the junction is very narrow(results in lower breakdown voltage and highly doped so the space-charge region is narrower), and a quantum-mechanical process called quantum tunnelling can take place. In effect, electrons from the p-side valence band are able to tunnel across the barrier into the empty states in the n-side conduction band when a small reverse bias is applied. The result is a strong current from n to p in the diode, causing zener breakdown.<br/>For diodes with lighter doping or with a graded junction, the avalanche mechanism is the operative breakdown process. In this effect, the electric field in the transition region becomes strong enough under reverse bias to accelerate carriers to quite high kinetic energy.

            The net charge neutrality of the space charge region is still maintained as was the case in the signal diode but the thickness of the space charge region is quite high and deeply penetrated into the Nâ€“ region.<br/>This is due to its light doping concentration, as we know that the thickness of the space charge region increases with a decrease in doping concentration.<br/>This increased thickness of the depletion region or the space charge region helps the diode to block larger reverse-biased voltage and hence have a greater breakdown voltage.<br/>However, adding this Nâ€“ layer significantly increases the ohmic resistance of the diode leading to more heat generation during the forwarding conduction state. Hence power diodes come with various mountings for proper heat dissipation.<br/>In signal diodes for forward-biased regions the current increases exponentially however in power diodes, high forward current leads to high ohmic drop which dominates the exponential growth and the curve increases almost linearly.

            Photovoltaic panels can be wired or connected together in either series or parallel combinations, or both to increase the voltage or current capacity of the solar array. If the array panels are connected together in a series combination, then the voltage increases and if connected together in parallel then the current increases.<br/>The maximum power point (MPP) of a solar cell is positioned near the bend in the I-V characteristics curve. The corresponding values of Vmp and Imp can be estimated from the open circuit voltage and the short circuit current: Vmp â‰… (0.8â€“0.90)Voc and Imp â‰… (0.85â€“0.95)Isc. Since solar cell output voltage and current both depend on temperature, the actual output power will vary with changes in ambient temperature.

            Step 1: Pre-check and Pretreatment
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">
            The raw silicon wafer disks first undergo a pre-check during which they are inspected on their geometric shape and thickness conformity and on damages such as cracks, breakages, scratches, or other anomalities.<br/>Following this pre-check, the wafers are split and cleaned with industrial soaps to remove any metal residues, liquids or other production remains from the surface that would otherwise impact the efficiency of that wafer.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg py-2 leading-8 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 underline">
            Step 2: Texturing
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">
            For monocrystalline silicon wafers, the most common technique is random pyramid texturing which involves the coverage of the surface with aligned upward-pointing pyramid structures.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg py-2 leading-8 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 underline">
            Step 3: Acid Cleaning
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">
              After texturing, the wafers undergo acidic rinsing (or: acid cleaning). In this step, any post-texturing particle remains are removed from the surface.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg py-2 leading-8 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 underline">
            Step 4: Diffusion
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">
            Diffusion is basically the process of adding a dopant to the silicon wafer to make it more electrically conductive. There are basically 2 methods of diffusion: solid-state diffusion and emitter diffusion.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg py-2 leading-8 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 underline">
            Step 5: Etching & Edge Isolation
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">
            During diffusion, the n-type phosphorous diffuses not only into the desired wafer surface but also around the edges of the wafer as well as on the backside, creating an electrical path between the front and backside and in this way also preventing electrical isolation between the two sides.<br/>The objective of the etching and edge isolation process is to remove this electrical path around the wafer edge by disk stacking the cells on top of each other and then exposing them to a plasma etching chamber using tetrafluoromethane (CF4) to etch exposed edges.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg py-2 leading-8 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 underline">
            Step 6: Post-Etching Washing
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">
            After the etching, particle residues' potential remains on the wafer and the wafer edges. Therefore the wafers need to undergo a second washing to remove the remains of the previous etching process.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg py-2 leading-8 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 underline">
            Step 7: Anti-Reflective Coating Deposition
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">
            In addition to surface texturing, AR coating is often applied on the surface to further reduce reflection and increase the amount of light absorbed into the cell.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg py-2 leading-8 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 underline">
            Step 8: Contact Printing and Drying
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">
            As the next step, metal inlines are printed on the wafer with the objective to create ohmic contacts. These metal inlines are printed on the rear side of the wafer, which is called backside printing.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg py-2 leading-8 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 underline">
            Step 9: Testing and Cell Sorting
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">
            In this final process, the now ready-to-assemble solar cells are tested under simulated sunlight conditions and then classified and sorted according to their efficiencies.

            The Bi-polar Junction Transistors (BJT) are semiconductor devices in which both electrons and holes participate in the conduction process. As compared to the unipolar devices where there is only one type of carrier that take part predominantly in the conduction process. BJT is made up of 2 PN junction that in close contact to interact with each other. And the coupling of 2 p-n junction result in transistor action.<br/>The modern days BJTs are made up of 3 terminals, the base, emitter and collector. The width of the base region is the smallest to allow the carriers injected from emitter to be able to diffuse through the base and reach the base-collector depletion region. While the emitter region has the largest doping concentration where carriers are injected to the base in the active mode. Followed by the collector region which has the smallest doping concentration. <br/>This junctions of the BJT can be biased in different ways. By having a input and output at 2 of the 3 junction respectively, we can have the one without input or output to be the common. Common Base, Common Emitter, Common Collector which also give different IV graphs based on the different biased.

The reduce in base width will cause the gradient in minority-carrier concentration to increase. And results in increase in diffusion current  Ic and hence common-emitter gain also increase.

            A MOSFET is a four-terminal device having source(S), gate (G), drain (D) and body (B) terminals. In general, The body of the MOSFET is in connection with the source terminal thus forming a three-terminal device such as a field-effect transistor. <br/>
            The semiconductor surface at the below oxide layer which is located between the source and drain terminal can be inverted from p-type to n-type by the application of either a positive or negative gate voltages respectively.  When we apply a repulsive force for the positive gate voltage, then the holes present beneath the oxide layer are pushed downward with the substrate.<br/>
            The depletion region populated by the bound negative charges which are associated with the acceptor atoms. When electrons are reached, a channel is developed. The positive voltage also attracts electrons from the n+ source and drain regions into the channel. Now, if a voltage is applied between the drain and source, the current flows freely between the source and drain and the gate voltage controls the electrons in the channel. Instead of the positive voltage, if we apply a negative voltage, a hole channel will be formed under the oxide layer.

            As mentioned earlier in the â€˜Diodeâ€™ Section, Zener Diode are highly doped diodes which allow for Zener Breakdown to occur easily, allowing for flow of current in either directions.<br/>To achieve this highly doped junction, we will start off with the same substrate but ion implant both Boron (Blue) and Phosphorus(Red). Boron will be implanted first and will be deeper into the substrate.

            The simulator has been configured to produce a concentration gradient that follows the gaussian function.<br/>Heat is then applied to spread the concentration evenly through diffusion. However, too much heat will increase diffusion, lowering the concentration below the intended 1018. Hence, for the sake of simplicity we will lower both the time and temperature of the heat treatment the wafer undergoes. This change can be made by changing the numerical value directly as  seen below:

            <p className="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">
            The effect of the diffusion can be seen clearly as the concentration profile is now more evenly distributed across the cross-section of the wafer. Furthermore, it can be observed that the overall highest concentration of the substrate has decreased for both Boron and Phosphorus which aligns to the principle of gaussian profile of dopant concentration under thermal diffusion.
